About this repo
---------------

This repository contains scripts and dotfiles to configure Ubuntu 16.04 Unity  to my personal preferences.  No other Ubuntu flavors or versions have been tested.

The scripts also install apps and tools that I consider essential.

##How to run
Once you have installed Ubuntu 16.04 Unity, clone this repository. 
Then, execute the following commands:
```
$ cd TuneUbuntu
$ ./TuneUbuntu.sh
$ ./InstallDevelopmentStuff.sh
```
Omit running the script ``` InstallDevelopmentStuff.sh ``` if you do not want programming tools and apps to be installed.

## Notes

Please check the source code, since there are multiple configuration and installation steps that have been commented. You may find those useful.
